Scraping "weather.gov", i.e the official website of the US that provides weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property.

Making the use of various Python:snake: libraries like:

* BeautifulSoup :stew:
* requests :arrows_counterclockwise:
* pandas :panda_face:

Also, **Chrome DevTools** making it easier.

Eventually, putting the data in a .csv extension file. :sparkles:
