Scraping the extended weather forecast from "weather.gov", i.e the official website of the US that provides weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property.

(The code does it for Los Angeles, to change the cities across the Country simply change the city on the webpage and copy and paste the URL in the code :innocent:)

Making the use of various Python:snake: libraries like:

* BeautifulSoup :stew:
* requests :arrows_counterclockwise:
* pandas :panda_face:

Also, **Chrome DevTools** making it easier.

Eventually, putting the data in a .csv extension file. :sparkles:
